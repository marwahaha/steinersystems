The search for a new Steiner system:

2020-01-11
I wrote brute-force code that found S(2,3,7). With some optimizations, it could find S(2,3,9).

2020-01-19
I used the lexographic trick to reproduce S(5,8,24) (24-bits, groups of 8, avoid overlaps over 4)
I tried adjusting the trick to find other Steiner systems, but this was unsuccessful.

Future
I could try investigating the PSL_2 group, and see if it could be applied to S(7,x,y) systems.
I could also try local search algorithms, starting from the lexographic trick or brute-force code.

It might be nice to share the webpage with others to identify other approaches.
